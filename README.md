# 📊 Data Structure Visualizer

A **Java Swing-based GUI application** to visualize various data structures and algorithms for learning and understanding their working.  
This project helps students and developers better understand core concepts of data structures through an interactive visual interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visualize common data structures:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Step-by-step algorithm animations
- User-friendly **Swing-based GUI**
- Real-time updates for operations such as insert, delete, search, traverse
- Educational tool for students learning **Data Structures & Algorithms**

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Understanding data structures through theory is hard. This project allows **interactive learning** by visually representing data structure operations.  
Ideal for **students, educators, and competitive programmers**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java SE** (Core Java)
- **Swing GUI**
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **Event-driven Programming**
